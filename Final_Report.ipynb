    "Our project will examine the 6% of the internet commonly known as the dark web. The dark web is notorious for its unrestricted content and the growing markets that support the circulation of illicit goods or services. The promised anonymity induced an increase in criminal activity on the dark web; darknet marketplaces became populated with buyers. This, in turn, allowed for the flourishing of several cryptomarkets even if it was only for a short period of time. The average darknet market lasted slightly over eight months before its closure. The longest lasting market still in existence established in 2013 (EMCDDA). However, the main focus for this project is not the lifetime of cryptomarkets but instead the lifespan of vendors.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of discourses for this topic include the investigation into the relationship between cryptocurrency and illegal activity, the discussion on impacts of police crackdowns on cryptomarkets, the geographical analysis on popular markets and etc. (Gwern et al.). With that said, the spotlight is often shifted away from the vendors who are crucial to the markets itself. The purpose of this project is to identify, analyze, and compare the characteristics of successful vendors and characteristics of their counterparts in order to increase the number of successful sellers; we want to promote a more effective market. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "We define ‘successful vendors’ to meet 2 basic criterias: long life span and high rating. We will investigate and explain the geographical distribution of illegal goods and services and provide analysis on seller lifetimes using the metadata on one of the cryptomarkets, Agora. We ask questions such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- How does category popularity change by country? \n",
    "- What is the correlation between a seller’s reputation and their lifespan? How much longer can top rated vendors stay in market compared to low rated vendors? Are sellers consistently active? \n",
    "- Do vendors tend to sell goods and/or services in only one category? If they sell in multiple categories, are their lifespans the same for all the categories?\n",
    "- What do successful vendors have in common? Are what top rated, active vendors selling in congruence with the rest of the vendors? What exactly are they selling?"

    "We begin by looking at where the majority of vendors are located for each category. The following choropleth maps created using the Kaggle data depict the frequency of listings in different categories by country, providing insight to where most competitions are for a given category. Based on the categories given we simplified them to 5 categories: drugs, services, counterfeits, weapons, and miscellaneous. The drugs category is consisted of anything that pertains to drugs and tobacco. The services category is consisted of stolen accounts to multiple websites such as Netflix, Hulu, HBO, etc. The counterfeits category is composed of fake clothing, credit cards, passports, etc. The weapons category contained guns, ammo, etc. Lastly, the miscellaneous category contained listings that did not fall under any of the 4 categories mentioned above which will not be explored here due to its randomness."

    "The top country with the most frequent listings for drugs, services, and weapons is the United States sitting at around 32,000, 360, and 120 listings respectively. One explanation is during the years 2014 to 2015, Agora was one of the Dark Web’s biggest drug market. It is estimated that the market was making about \\$150,000 a day in sales alone from acting as a middleman between sellers and buyers (Greenberg). Its influence was so vast that it had more product listings than any other drug market at the time of its peak (Greenberg). Another explanation why is due to the United States’ postal service system. The postal service became a popular method for the transportation of drugs because even though it was monitored by law enforcement, actual investigation proved to be difficult and tedious. Also, state and local law enforcement do not have jurisdiction in the investigation of drugs shipped through the U.S. Postal Service. These factors could have enabled the United States to have the most frequent listings in the drugs category on the Agora marketplace (darkwebnews.com). \n",
    "\n",
    "The United States might have dominated the categories services and guns due to its popularity among people living there. Items in the service category are easy to sell because most of the items can be received online, but there was not a huge market for it. Regarding guns specifically, the amount of listings is too low for it to be significant for analysis or the low count may be an indicator that weapons are significantly harder to sell than drugs. It may explain why they are not as popular as drugs because they are commonplace in the real world so it is not as profitable in the market."

Many Chinese vendors on the dark web are known for stolen data and forged documents which may explain why they have the highest frequency of listings in the counterfeit category. In addition, since a vendor's location may not be their actual location, listing China as the source for a counterfeit good may give credence to this reputation as well. It is also possible that there may have been a Chinese only market (darkwebnews.com).\n",

Their presence in a majority English-speaking medium shows us that China is dominating in the counterfeit good territory and can even dominate foreign markets.\n",

The top 20 active, highest rated sellers focus on sales in 3 prominent categories: drugs, miscellaneous, and services, respectively. We initially expect the activity levels in each category for the rest of the vendors to reflect the proportions for each category for top active vendors.

One thing to note is the term ‘weapons’ is extremely broad here; anything that can inflict damage would be considered a weapon. In that case, there are less incentives to buying in the darknet market as buying 'weapons' in the real world would be a safer alternative.

Regardless of the potential reasons behind the popularity of Cannabis amongst Agora users, we can see current the current laws of the prohibition of Cannabis is widely unpopular.<br>\n",

This tells us that one of the most sustainable markets in Agora is for ebooks. This may come from the ease in generating or providing eBooks. Another reason why successful vendors have longer lifespans in this market may be because law enforcement agencies may not be looking for people who illegally share books online. This makes it a lot safer and sustainable for vendors to thrive and survive in this market and may also be why top rated, active vendors tend not to sell in the drugs market in Agora."

We may also want to know if vendors collectively go to the same new market when the current market closes or if they stop selling in general."
